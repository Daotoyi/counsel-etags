* counsel-etags (v1.1.7)

Fast and complete Ctags solution in Emacs.

It's tested in huge projects like Linux Kernel source.

It's still usable even with *one million* candidates.

* Install
Place counsel-etags.el somewhere (say ~/.emacs/lisp), add below code into ".emacs":

#+begin_src elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/")
(require 'counsel-etags)
#+end_src

* Usage
Run =M-x counsel-etags-find-tag-at-point= to navigate in code files without any setup.

This command will:
- find project root folder and scan code *automatically*
- find correct tag *automatically*
- if no tag is find, it grep *automatically*

That's it.

If you prefer manually setup tags file. You only need run =M-x counsel-etags-scan-code= once.
* Tips (OPTIONAL)
** tags-file-name
We try to automatically setup Emacs global variable =tags-file-name= if it's nil.

If it's not nil, we respect =tags-file-name=. Please note we don't support =tags-table-list=.
** Auto update tags file
#+begin_src
(add-hook 'after-save-hook 'counsel-etags-update-tags-file)
(setq counsel-etags-update-interval 300) ; 300 seconds, OPTIONAL
#+end_src
** Ctags setup
Google "filetype:ctags site:github.com". Here is [[https://gist.github.com/redguardtoo/b12ddae3b8010a276e9b][mine]].

You may need configure environment variable "HOME" on Windows because Ctags looks for "%HOME%/.ctags" by default.
** Search with negative pattern
All counsel-etags commands supports negative pattern from [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy]].

You can filter the candidates with =keyword1 !keyword2 keyword3=. So we display only candidate containing =keyword1= but neither =keyword2= nor =keyword3=.

You can also press =C-c C-o= to create a buffer containing all candidates.

In summary, all functionalities from powerful [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy]] are supported perfectly.
** Grep program
If [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][ripgrep]] is installed, it's used as faster grep program. Or else we fallback to grep.
** Windows
No extra setup is needed if you install Cygwin to its default location on any driver. Or else, you could setup =counsel-etags-find-program=, =counsel-etags-ctags-program=, and =counsel-etags-grep-program=.
